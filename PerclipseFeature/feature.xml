   <description url="http://www.perfidix.org/">
      Perfidix is a tool for developers to conveniently and consistently benchmark Java code. It can quickly answer which implementation is faster. Without the need to launch a full-fledged profiling application or rewrite the same Java code to measure the execution time again and again.

Eventhough Perfidix is simple to use, it still provides a sound statistical output for taking a decision.

Perfidix is intentionally designed to be used like JUnit 4.x, i.e., it provides annotations to discover which methods should be benchmarked how many times. The eclipse plugin or custom code allows to run a package, class, or project as a Perfidix benchmark and to collect the execution time statistics for each method in the console as text, CVS, or XML output.
