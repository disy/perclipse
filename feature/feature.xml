      Perfidix is a tool for developers to conveniently and consistently benchmark Java code. It can quickly answer which implementation is faster. Without the need to launch a full-fledged profiling application or rewrite the same Java code to measure the execution time again and again.

Even though Perfidix is simple to use, it still provides a sound statistical output for taking a decision.

Perclipse offers a direct, eclipse-included tool to interact with perfidix on a basic level.
